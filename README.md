# Calculator

### Introduction
The Calculator project marks the culmination of the foundational course provided by The Odin Project. Throughout this journey, I have learned various new concepts while reinforcing some existing ones. This project serves as a practical application of my learning, showcasing my skills in web development.

### Project Description
The Calculator is a web application that brings together various concepts learned throughout the course, including HTML structure, CSS styling, and DOM manipulation using JavaScript. This project demonstrates the ability to create a functional and aesthetically pleasing user interface. Key features include:

1. **User-Friendly Interface**: A seamless UI that allows users to input numbers and operations easily.
2. **Functional Operations**: Implements basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It also includes a clear button to reset the calculator.
3. **Responsive Design**: Aesthetic design that adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring usability on both desktop and mobile devices.
4. **Error Handling**: Provides feedback for invalid operations, such as division by zero.
5. **Additional Features**: Future enhancements may include support for decimal inputs, keyboard support, and a history of calculations.

### Expectations
This project is expected to present some challenges because it requires careful planning regarding the interaction between the UI and the backend. Additional features may be added as necessary.
