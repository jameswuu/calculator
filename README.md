# Calculator

### Introduction
The Calculator project marks the culmination of the foundational course provided by The Odin Project. Throughout this journey, I have learned various new concepts while reinforcing some existing ones. This project serves as a practical application of my learning, showcasing my skills in web development.

### Project Description
The Calculator is a web application that brings together various concepts learned throughout the course, including HTML structure, CSS styling, and DOM manipulation using JavaScript. This project demonstrates the ability to create a functional and aesthetically pleasing user interface. Key features include:

1. **User-Friendly Interface**: A seamless UI that allows users to input numbers and operations easily.
2. **Functional Operations**: Implements basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It also includes a clear button to reset the calculator.
3. **Responsive Design**: Aesthetic design that adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring usability on both desktop and mobile devices.
4. **Error Handling**: Provides feedback for invalid operations, such as division by zero.
5. **Additional Features**: Future enhancements may include support for decimal inputs, keyboard support, and a history of calculations.

### Expectations
This project is expected to present some challenges because it requires careful planning regarding the interaction between the UI and the backend.

### After Thoughts
I completed this project after two full days of hard coding. I encountered many different problems that I had never faced before, especially since it includes various features like addition, subtraction, and more that need to work together. This posed many challenges, as establishing the conditions in the if statements sometimes conflicted and contradicted each other. I utilized many resources, including open-source help from Stack Overflow, Odin's Project content, and OpenAI.

Before starting this project, I was extremely excited but also anxious about my ability to complete it. Despite my lack of coding experience, I learned a lot and became a better programmer overall. From brainstorming ideas and planning the necessary features and functions to coding and eventually revisiting and adjusting my ideas when things didnâ€™t work as expected, the process was invaluable.

Overall, the project was challenging, but I enjoyed the struggle, which has made me a better problem solver and programmer. There is still a long way for me to go in the world of computer science. I believe I will continuously encounter many roadblocks or even setbacks in my journey to becoming a full-stack programmer. However, my determination, agility, and goals to become a programmer will help me through all the challenges!
